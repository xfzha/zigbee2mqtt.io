## Zigbee Adapters

Zigbee2MQTT supportes a range of Adapters whichs enables the communication with the Zigbee radio network.
Most adapters are connected on a USB port but there are options to use GPIO-Pins or [connect it remotly](../advanced/remote-adapter/connect_to_a_remote_adapter.md)
over TCP usung a WIFI or Ethernet network. See the [list of supported Zigbee Adapters](./adapters/)

## Zigbee Devices

Currently there are plenty of [supported Zigbee Devices](../supported-devices/) with a rising trend.
If your device is not supported yet check out [how to support new devices](../advanced/support-new-devices/01_support_new_devices.md) and contribute to Zigbee2MQTT.

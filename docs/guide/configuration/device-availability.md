# Device-Availability

The availability feature checks whether your devices are online. The availability state of a device is published
to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/availability` with the payload being `online` or `offline`.

```yaml
# Optional: Enable the availability feature (default = false)
availability: true
```

The availability feature works differently for active and passive devices.

- Active devices (routers or mains powered end devices): by default they have to check-in every 10 minutes. If they
  don't, they will be pinged, if that fails the device will be marked as `offline`.
- Passive devices (everything that is not an active device, mostly battery powered devices): these devices need to
  check-in every 25 hours, they cannot be pinged so if they don't they will be marked as `offline`.

Note that this timeout is persisted between Zigbee2MQTT restarts. So if you e.g. stop Zigbee2MQTT for longer than 10
minutes, all yours active devices will be marked as `offline` initially.

## Availability advanced configuration

Instead of setting `availability: true` in your `configuration.yaml` you can provide a more advanced configuration:

```yaml
# Note: all options are optional
availability:
  active:
    # Time after which an active device will be marked as offline in
    # minutes (default = 10 minutes)
    timeout: 10
  passive:
    # Time after which a passive device will be marked as offline in
    # minutes (default = 1500 minutes aka 25 hours)
    timeout: 1500

devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: 'my_bulb'
    # Set availablility: false to disable the availability feature for a specific device
    availability: false
  '0x87654321':
    friendly_name: 'my_switch'
    # Change availibity timeout to 3 minutes for this device only
    availability:
      timeout: 3
```

If you want to enable the availability feature for only certain devices, don't add `availability: true` in
your `configuration.yaml` but specify it for that device only, e.g.

```yaml
devices:
  '0x87654321':
    friendly_name: 'my_switch'
    # Enable avaiability for just 'my_switch'
    availability: true
```

## State retrieval

When the availability feature is enabled and a device reconnects or announces itself on the network, Zigbee2MQTT will retrieve the
state of the device. This is e.g. handy when a bulb turns itself on after being reconnected to mains power. The
following attributes will be read: `state`, `brightness`, `color_temp` and `color`.

## Performance considerations

- The pinging can be heavy on the coordinator, especially if you are using a CC2530 or CC2531 adapter.
- Higher `timeout` for active devices results in less pinging so less stress on the coordinator.

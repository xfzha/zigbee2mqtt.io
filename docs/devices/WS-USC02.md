## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `device_temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the device_temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Switch (top endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_top` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_top": "ON"}`, `{"state_top": "OFF"}` or `{"state_top": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_top": ""}`.

### Switch (bottom endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_bottom` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_bottom": "ON"}`, `{"state_bottom": "OFF"}` or `{"state_bottom": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_bottom": ""}`.

### Operation_mode (enum, top endpoint)
Decoupled mode for top button.
Value can be found in the published state on the `operation_mode_top` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"operation_mode_top": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"operation_mode_top": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `control_relay`, `decoupled`.

### Operation_mode (enum, bottom endpoint)
Decoupled mode for bottom button.
Value can be found in the published state on the `operation_mode_bottom` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"operation_mode_bottom": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"operation_mode_bottom": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `control_relay`, `decoupled`.

### Mode_switch (enum)
Anti flicker mode can be used to solve blinking issues of some lights.Quick mode makes the device respond faster..
Value can be found in the published state on the `mode_switch` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"mode_switch": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"mode_switch": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `anti_flicker_mode`, `quick_mode`.

### Power_outage_count (numeric)
Number of power outages (since last pairing).
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_outage_count` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Device_temperature (numeric)
Temperature of the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `device_temperature` property.

To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"flip_indicator_light": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` flip_indicator_light is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Power_outage_memory (binary)
Enable/disable the power outage memory, this recovers the on/off mode after power failure.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_outage_memory` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_outage_memory": ""}`.

### Pairing
Switch the thermostat off. Press and hold the temperature down button for +- 8 seconds to enable the pairing mode (display lights up and a WiFi-like icon is blinking). After successful interview turn the thermostat on again.

### Stop message flooding
This unit has a bug that makes it send multiple messages when updating. To stop this from flooding your MQTT Queues, please add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:


devices:
  '0x12345678':

## Exposes

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `child_lock` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": "LOCK"}` or `{"child_lock": "UNLOCK"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `system_mode`, `preset`, `fan_mode`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `45`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `cool`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `hold`, `program`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to be used in the local_temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-10` and the maximum value is `10` with a step size of `0.1`.

### Sensor (enum)
Select temperature sensor to use.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensor` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensor": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `IN`, `AL`, `OU`.

### Programming_mode (composite)
Schedule MODE ⏱ - In this mode, the device executes a preset week programming temperature time and temperature..
- `week` (enum): Week format user for schedule allowed values: `5+2`, `6+1`, `7`
- `workdays_schedule` (text) 
- `holidays_schedule` (text) 

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

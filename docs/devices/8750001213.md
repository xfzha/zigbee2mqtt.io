### Pairing
To pair this device you have to install the device via its installation code which you can get by scanning the QR-code sticker on the physical device with your smartphone. Then get the device into pairing mode. In zigbee2mqtt navigate to  "Settings" --> "Tools" and click on "Add install code". Paste the code you got from the QR-code and confirm by clicking "OK" which will get zigbee2mqtt into pairing mode automatically. Wait for your device to be joined.


### Factory resetting
To factory reset the device remove one of the batteries. While pressing and holding the device's main button, insert the battery back. As soon as the device's LED is starting to blink orange, release the device's main button and press and hold it again until the device's LED is lighting up green. You will know that the device is being set back to factory defaults successfully when an acustic signal is being thrown by the device. The device will reboot, which can take up to a minute.

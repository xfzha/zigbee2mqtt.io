## Notes


### Pairing
Pair the remote to Zigbee2MQTT by holding it close to the coordinator and
pressing the inside button, next to the CR2032 battery, 4 times.
The red light on the (front of the) remote will now flash a few times.

### Troubleshooting: no battery level
It may help to remove the battery for a few seconds and after that reconfigure it via [Configure](../guide/usage/mqtt_topics_and_messages.md#zigbee2mqttbridgeconfigure). Right before executing the Configure make sure to wake up the device by pressing a button on it.


### Binding
The remote can be bound to groups using [binding](../guide/usage/binding.md) since firmware 2.3.014.
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time. Use the group name as `TARGET_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME`.
By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
This can be done by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/unbind` payload `{"from": "DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME", "to": "default_bind_group"}`.
Wake up the device right before sending the commands by pressing a button on it.

Once bound to a group/bulb you will notice that the toggle and brightness buttons will work, but scenes/color temperature most likely won't work. This appears to be a missing piece of functionality ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/1232)), but via a workaround this can be managed;
1. Create a group with ID **65289** (name it ie. Trafri_scenes) and add the device(s) you control with the remote.
2. Add/store [scenes](../guide/usage/scenes.md) for the created group
3. Once you click left/right on the remote, the scenes will be called sequentially (should there be a device off sync in scenes, hold the toggle button for 3 sec.).

#### Note
This device with old firmware < 2.3.014 does not support binding (limitation of the device). A workaround is to first
get the group ID where the remote is sending it's commands to and add bulbs to the
same group ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/782#issuecomment-514526256)).

1. Pair the IKEA TRADFRI remote control to Zigbee2MQTT.
2. Enable debug logging (log_level: debug) ([documentation](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)).
3. You will get log output like this: `10/3/2019, 9:28:02 AM - debug: Received Zigbee message from '0x90fd9ffffe90d778'
of type 'commandToggle' with data '{}' from endpoint 1 with groupID 57173`.
4. Retrieve the group from the log output, which is `57173` in the above example.
5. Add this group to `configuration.yaml` and add your device (e.g.) bulb to this group.
([documentation](../guide/usage/groups.md)).

### Toggle button
When clicking the middle (center) button on the remote it will send a `{"click": "toggle"}`, when holding it
it will **also** send a `{"click": "toggle_hold"}`. It is not possible to skip the `toggle` when the button is hold.
Also the remote won't send anything when the button is released.
See [link](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2077#issuecomment-538691885) for more details.

The possible values are: `arrow_left_click`, `arrow_left_hold`, `arrow_left_release`, `arrow_right_click`, `arrow_right_hold`, `arrow_right_release`, `brightness_down_click`, `brightness_down_hold`, `brightness_down_release`, `brightness_up_click`, `brightness_up_hold`, `brightness_up_release`, `toggle`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
